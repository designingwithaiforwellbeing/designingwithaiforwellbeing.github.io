                            <p>Designing with data and AI can bring significant value to developing systems and technologies that promote physical and mental wellbeing. 
                            However, there are also challenges and risks connected to designing (with) AI for wellbeing, such as the difficulties in ensuring that generated feedback or proposed interventions 
                            will be interpreted correctly depending on the user's data literacy, and relevant considering the large interpersonal variations between the personal health data of different individuals. 
                            In this one-day hybrid workshop, we aim to explore how we can design with AI for wellbeing, promoting meaningful and ethical solutions while mitigating possible negative consequences. 
                            We call for position papers and short empirical, theoretical or methodological papers (up to 2500 words, single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template, submitted by email to the organizers) 
                            addressing challenges and opportunities related to designing (with) AI for wellbeing (see <a href="#Workshop_themes">here</a> a detailed list of potential topics). 
                            The submissions will be selected based on their ability to trigger discussion and coverage of diverse topics. While we focus on human wellbeing for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, 
                            we also welcome papers about other concepts of wellbeing, including post-human perspectives. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited for publication in a special issue. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop. 
                            All participants must register for both the workshop and at least one day of the conference.</p>
                            <p>
                                After the workshop, we plan to publish the material generated during the workshop (ideas, sketches, position papers, conceptual framework) on the website. Accepted submissions will also be published on the website upon agreement with the authors. We will also invite authors of selected position papers to submit an extended and revised version of their contribution to a special issue of the Behaviour & Information Technology journal by Taylor & Francis.

                            In this workshop we will map opportunities and challenges related to designing (with) AI for wellbeing
                            and discuss possible approaches to mitigating negative consequences. Our aim is to create a conceptual framework that can guide HCI researchers and practitioners 
                            in designing (with) AI for wellbeing. The workshop will focus on human wellbeing, from the perspective of designing applications and systems related to promoting, 
                            achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle at an individual level, considering psychological, physical and social dimensions.
                            However, we also welcome papers that critically connect this theme with research on designing AI systems in healthcare, 
                            or other concepts of wellbeing beyond the individual, such as wellbeing in the context of human-nature interaction.

                            The workshop is organized as a one full-day workshop with two parts. The morning session will
                            be focused on discussing and mapping methodological approaches, reflections and argumentations related to designing
                            with AI for wellbeing based on case studies. In the afternoon session, we will use design fiction activities using
                            ideation material (e.g. inspired by tools for envisioning AI capabilities) to collaboratively envision positive and
                            negative scenarios utilizing AI-enabled systems for promoting wellbeing. Finally, we will create a conceptual framework
                            synthesizing the discussed approaches and generated ideas. The preliminary workshop schedule is as follows:
