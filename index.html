                                <p>Designing with data and AI can bring significant value to developing systems and technologies that promote physical and mental wellbeing. 
                                    However, there are also challenges and risks connected to designing (with) AI for wellbeing, such as the difficulties in ensuring that 
                                    generated feedback or proposed interventions will be interpreted correctly depending on the user's data literacy, and relevant considering 
                                    the large interpersonal variations between the personal health data of different individuals. In this one-day hybrid workshop, we aim to 
                                    explore how we can design with AI for wellbeing, promoting meaningful and ethical solutions while mitigating possible negative consequences. 
                                    We call for position papers and short empirical, theoretical or methodological papers (up to 2500 words excluding references, single-column ACM Master Article Submission Template, 
                                    submitted by email to the organizers) addressing challenges and opportunities related to designing (with) AI for wellbeing 
                                    (see <a href="#Workshop_themes">here</a> potential topics). The submissions will be 
                                    selected based on their ability to trigger discussion and coverage of diverse topics. While we focus on human wellbeing 
                                    for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, we also welcome papers about other concepts of wellbeing. </p>

                                submissions will be invited for publication in a special issue. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend 
                                the workshop. All participants must register for both the workshop and at least one day of the conference.</p>

                        In this workshop we will map opportunities and challenges related to designing (with) AI for wellbeing
                        and discuss possible approaches to mitigating negative consequences. Our aim is to create a conceptual framework that can guide HCI researchers and practitioners 
                        in designing (with) AI for wellbeing. The workshop will focus on human wellbeing, from the perspective of designing applications and systems related to promoting, 
                        achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle at an individual level, considering psychological, physical and social dimensions.
                        However, we also welcome papers that critically connect this theme with research on designing AI systems in healthcare, 
                        or other concepts of wellbeing beyond the individual, such as wellbeing in the context of human-nature interaction.
